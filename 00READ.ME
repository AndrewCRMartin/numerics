This is the Worden Ware Numerics library from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/numeric/
(there was also a web page at
http://www.Brent.Worden.org/products/numericsc.html
but this no longer appears to be available)

I have taken the ZIP file and converted the files to remove DOS
carriage returns. 

The makefile is also mine.

Note that the files use the C++ comment style, so must be compiled
using g++ rather than gcc

This code was released under the GNU LGPLv2
