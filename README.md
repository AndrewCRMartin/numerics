Numerics

This is the Worden Ware Numerics library originally available at
http://www.Brent.Worden.org/products/numericsc.html
and now available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/numeric/

The `Readme.txt` provided by Worden states that "there are no conditions on its
use".

I have taken the ZIP file and converted the files to remove DOS
carriage returns. 

The Makefile is also mine.

Note that the files use the C++ comment style, so must be compiled
using g++ rather than gcc

As per the original licence, there are no conditions on its use.
