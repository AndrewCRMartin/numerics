Numerics C Library is a collection of routines to do numerical and statistical
computations.  Included in this library are routines to solve linear systems of
equations, generate random numbers, compute values for random variables, as well
as various other routines that are commonly needed in science and engineering
fields as well as other disciplines.

Full C source code is provided in the library and there are no conditions on its
use.  However, if you feel it neccessary to give me some credit in your work, I
will not object to your citation.

If you have any questions on its use, discover any bugs in the code, or run into
difficulties compiling the software, feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your interest in Numerics C Library
